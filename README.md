Basic calculations with Javascript.
With a given dataset - what contained two field of arrays: Date and Profit/Loss - the following records had to be calculated.

-the total number of months included in the dataset
-The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
-The avarage of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period
-The greatest increase in profits(date and amount) over the entire period
-The greatest decrease in profits(date and amount) over the entire period

For this I used basic html/css to present the data and basic Javascript to make the calculations.
